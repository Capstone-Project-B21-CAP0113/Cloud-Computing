Authenticate API Requests

1. Set an environment variable for [YOUR_PROJECT_ID], replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your own project ID:

"export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]"

2. Create a Service Account to access the Google Cloud APIs when testing locally:

"gcloud iam service-accounts create adminkopi \
  --display-name "Admin KoPi Service Account""

3. Give your newly created Service Account appropriate permissions:

"gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
--member serviceAccount:admmin@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/owner"

4. After creating your Service Account, create a Service Account key:

"gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
--iam-account adminkopi@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

5. Using the absolute path of the generated key, set an environment variable for your service account key:

"export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/${USER}/key.json""
